About the app:

This is an simple weather forecast application, that uses openweathermap's API to show you weather forecast of cities across the world. It features geolocation, celsius/fahrenheit switch, search option to find cities, and list of popular cities on the left side for quick access. The application also features simple but nice graphics. The background color changes depending on the weather and time of day of the selected city.

The app focuses on minimalism, and it aims to give you just the key information in quick manner. The strenght of the application is that you can check variety of cities across the world, fast, and it provides the key information immediately, so you can get idea of the weather for the day, and for the next 5 days at just quick glance. This is great for travellers with busy schedule, or for people who want to quickly find out weather of different cities out of curiosity.

The site might take few seconds to load your location, but other than that it's quite snappy and smooth.
